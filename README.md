kivy-chess
==========

Work in progress Chess Application using Kivy.

To Build
   1. Download Kivy
   2. Install and test that kivy works
   3. Execute "kivy main.py"
   4. To deploy to IOS/android, download the respective toolkits and use this project's rootdir.

Features
   1. Ability to play over human input moves.
   2. Observe engine output on positions.
   3. Take back and move forward.

Immediate TODO
   1. You can load any UCI engine, but it is now hardcoded to the Stockfish mac OS executable. I will soon provide a load engine dialog.

A lot more features to come.
