kivy-chess
==========

Work in progress Chess Application using Kivy.
Features
   1. Ability to play over human input moves.
   2. Observe engine output on positions.
   3. Take back and move forward.

Immediate TODO
   1. Currently drag and drop does not yet work, you have to click on the source and destination square. This will be fixed soon.
   2. You can load any UCI engine, but it is now hardcoded to the Stockfish mac OS executable. I will soon provide a load engine dialog.

A lot more features to come.
